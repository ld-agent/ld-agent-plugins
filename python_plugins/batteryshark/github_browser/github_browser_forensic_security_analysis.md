# üîç GitHub Browser: Forensic Analysis for Agentic Security & Code Review

## Overview

The GitHub Browser plugin now includes powerful **forensic analysis capabilities** that enable AI agents to perform deep security audits, bug investigations, and automated code review with unprecedented insight into code evolution and potential vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security-Focused Use Cases

### 1. **Vulnerability Introduction Detection**
AI agents can automatically track when and how security vulnerabilities were introduced:

```python
# Agent detects a potential SQL injection vulnerability
vulnerable_file = "src/database/query_builder.py"

# 1. Find when the vulnerable code was introduced
changes = search_file_changes(vulnerable_file, "execute(")
print(f"Found {changes['total_matches']} commits that modified execute() calls")

# 2. Get the exact commit that introduced the issue
for commit in changes['commits_with_code_changes']:
    print(f"Potential introduction: {commit['hash']} by {commit['author']}")
    print(f"Message: {commit['message']}")
    print(f"Changes: {commit['changes']}")

# 3. Compare with safe version before the vulnerability
safe_version = get_file_at_commit(vulnerable_file, "HEAD~10")
current_version = get_file_at_commit(vulnerable_file, "HEAD")

# 4. Generate security diff report
comparison = compare_file_versions(vulnerable_file, "HEAD~10", "HEAD")
print("Security-relevant changes:")
print(comparison['diff'])
```

### 2. **Authentication & Authorization Audit Trail**
Track changes to critical security functions:

```python
# Audit authentication system changes
auth_files = ["src/auth/login.py", "src/auth/permissions.py", "src/middleware/auth.py"]

for auth_file in auth_files:
    print(f"\nüîê Auditing {auth_file}")
    
    # Find all authentication-related changes
    auth_changes = search_file_changes(auth_file, "authenticate")
    token_changes = search_file_changes(auth_file, "token")
    permission_changes = search_file_changes(auth_file, "permission")
    
    # Generate security timeline
    history = get_file_history(auth_file, limit=20, include_patches=True)
    print(f"Authentication file modified {history['total_commits']} times")
    
    # Highlight recent critical changes
    for commit in history['commits'][:5]:
        if any(keyword in commit['message'].lower() for keyword in ['security', 'auth', 'login', 'token']):
            print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  SECURITY CHANGE: {commit['date']} - {commit['message']}")
```

### 3. **Dependency & Third-Party Code Analysis**
Monitor changes to critical dependencies and external integrations:

```python
# Track changes to package management and external APIs
security_files = [
    "requirements.txt", "package.json", "Gemfile", 
    "src/integrations/", "src/external/", "src/api/third_party.py"
]

for file_path in security_files:
    print(f"\nüì¶ Analyzing dependency changes in {file_path}")
    
    # Find when new dependencies were added
    dependency_history = get_file_history(file_path, limit=10)
    
    for commit in dependency_history['commits']:
        # Check for new packages or version changes
        old_version = get_file_at_commit(file_path, f"{commit['hash']}~1")
        new_version = get_file_at_commit(file_path, commit['hash'])
        
        if old_version and new_version:
            diff = compare_file_versions(file_path, f"{commit['hash']}~1", commit['hash'])
            if '+' in diff['diff']:  # New additions
                print(f"üö® NEW DEPENDENCY: {commit['date']} - {commit['message']}")
                print(f"Changes: {diff['diff']}")
```

## üöÄ Integration with AI Security Tools

```python
# Example: Integration with AI vulnerability scanners
class AISecurityAgent:
    def __init__(self, repo_path):
        self.repo_path = repo_path

## üìä Benefits for AI Agents

1. **Context-Aware Analysis**: Understand not just what code exists, but how it evolved
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Trace vulnerabilities back to their source
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring security issues across developers
4. **Automated Remediation**: Suggest fixes based on how similar issues were resolved
5. **Risk Assessment**: Prioritize security issues based on change frequency and author expertise
6. **Compliance Automation**: Generate audit trails and compliance reports automatically

## üîß Quick Start Example

```python
# Simple security audit example
from github_browser import *

# 1. Get repository info
repo_info = get_repository_info_from_git_folder(".", extract_repository_stats=True)
print(f"Auditing: {repo_info['org']}/{repo_info['repo_name']}")

# 2. Find all authentication-related files
auth_files = ["src/auth.py", "login.py", "authentication.py"]

# 3. Investigate recent changes to authentication
for auth_file in auth_files:
    print(f"\nüîê Investigating {auth_file}")
    
    # Check recent history
    history = get_file_history(auth_file, limit=10)
    if history:
        print(f"   Recent changes: {history['total_commits']} commits")
        
        # Look for password/token related changes
        token_changes = search_file_changes(auth_file, "token")
        if token_changes['total_matches'] > 0:
            print(f"   ‚ö†Ô∏è  {token_changes['total_matches']} token-related changes found")
            
            # Get details of the most recent change
            if token_changes['commits_with_code_changes']:
                recent_change = token_changes['commits_with_code_changes'][0]
                print(f"   Most recent: {recent_change['message']} by {recent_change['author']}")
```

This forensic analysis capability transforms AI agents from simple code scanners into sophisticated security investigators that can understand the full context and history of potential vulnerabilities.
